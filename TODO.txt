TODO:
- Add bossfight
- Start working on the bullet time powerup
- Start working on the UI for permanent power ups
- Refactor window creation to the WindowManager.h class
- Make an xp and leveling system
	- Create XP as a property of the player (float)
	- Save XP in a file
	- XP multiplier based on the killstreak that you have
- Make all of the file paths using crypto hidden
- Enemies that follow you
- Enemies with shields
- Enemies that take longer to take down
- Shield is way too broken (spawns right after you lose it when you have enough money)
- Decrease the amount of health pickups give, and this should be an improvable skill
Optional:

Optimization:
- Check what method takes the most of our CPU and attempt to delegate it to memory
- When we exit the game, the GlobalsInit function gets called again, make sure to stop any more resources from allocating
- Refactor event handling with switch

- Add bossfight
- Change how bullet speed is managed (right now it is a constant on the for loop when instantiating bullets, change it to a property of the bullet itself to go further with the appropriate layer, so maybe a function called MoveBullet())
- Add logger - Done
- Complete inheritance of virtual functions - Replaced
- Start working on the bullet time powerup
- Start working on the UI for permanent power ups
- Unique bullet collision cooldown (sometimes bullets will collide with each other too fast for them to be counted as separate bounces)

Optional:
- Make delta time an engine variable

Optimization:
- Check what method takes the most of our CPU and attempt to delegate it to memory

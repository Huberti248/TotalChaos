TODO:
- Add bossfight
- Start working on the bullet time powerup
- Start working on the UI for permanent power ups
- Refactor window creation to the WindowManager.h class
- Make an xp and leveling system
	- Create XP as a property of the player (float)
	- Save XP in a file
	- XP multiplier based on the killstreak that you have
- Make all of the file paths using crypto hidden
- Enemies with shields
- Shield is way too broken (spawns right after you lose it when you have enough money)
- Decrease the amount of health pickups give, and this should be an improvable skill
- Make sure users find the game challenging but not unfair (specially with the enemy variety)
- When the follower enemies collide with you, they stun you
- Make three behaviours for spawning enemies:
	* Easy (higher probability of getting normal enemies with slow paced enemy spawning).
	* Simple (standard probability of getting either enemies, relatively normal paced enemy spawning).
	* Extreme (higher probability of getting special enemies with fast paced enemy spawning).
(Think of this like the plants vs zombies wave system)
Optional:
- Maybe make a power up that will change the probability of the types of enemies
- Maybe the tanks/followers will give you more xp

Optimization:
- When we exit the game, the GlobalsInit function gets called again, make sure to stop any more resources from allocating
- Refactor event handling with switch
